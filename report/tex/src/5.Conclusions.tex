\lhead{\emph{Conclusions}}

We can extract two main conclusions of this project. The first one is that EDDL is a library with a lower performance with respect to TF in computing resources management, memory usage, execution time, model's learning progress.... However, it's also remarkable that EDDL is a new library still in development which has proven to support complex network architectures as the Double U-Net or 3-D CNN and is able to achieve good results, being the difference with TF in simpler models almost inappreciable.

The second main conclusion is that CNN have proven to be a useful tool for biomedical image segmentation and, in our case, for Multiple Sclerosis lesion segmentation. We are confident that they will play an important role in the future in medicine. 

Finally, when analyzing our CNN, we have also seen that Double U-Net doesn't present any remarkable improvement to U-Net when applied to MS lesion detection.
